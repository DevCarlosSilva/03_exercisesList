<!-- Write an algorithm that reads three integer values and checks whether they can be the sides of a triangle. If so, state what type of triangle they form: equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Property: The length of each side of a triangle is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
Equilateral Triangle: one that has the lengths of the three sides equal;
Isosceles triangle: one that has two equal side lengths. Therefore, every equilateral triangle is also isosceles;
Scalene Triangle: one that has the lengths of its three sides different. -->
