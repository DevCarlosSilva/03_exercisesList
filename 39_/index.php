<!-- In a Computer Science course, the student's grade is calculated from three grades assigned, respectively, to a laboratory work, a semester assessment and a final exam. Grades vary from 0 to 10 and the final grade is the weighted average of the three grades mentioned. The table below provides the weights: Laboratory Weight 2
Semiannual assessment Weight 3
Final exam Weight 5

Given the name of a student, their registration number and the three grades mentioned above, develop an algorithm to calculate the final grade and classification of each student. The classification is given according to the table below:
Final Grade Classification
[8.10]
[7.8]B
[6.7]C
[5.6] D
[0.5] R

Print the student's name, with their number, final grade and classification. -->
